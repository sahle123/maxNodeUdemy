## This repo isn't very helpful

I only made this repo to keep track of my code within the Node.js Udemy course that Max Schwarzmuller has done. 

_Note that if anyone decides to use this code, be warned that it is not 1-to-1 to what Max has written in his course. I made lots of modifications for my own understanding._
